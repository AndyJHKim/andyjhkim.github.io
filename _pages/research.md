I focus on research that bridges cognitive neuropsychology, computational methods, and statistical analysis, with a strong interest in the interdisciplinary challenges that emerge at their intersection.

This page outlines some of the research questions I’m currently investigating or plan to explore in the near future. If you're interested in collaborating - such as joining as an undergraduate research intern - feel free to reach out to me at kim4648@purdue.edu.

For a complete list of publications, please see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=c0PqBXwAAAAJ&hl=en).


## Word size representation in the brain
When we see a word, how does the brain represent its size? Is this representation grounded in real-world physical size, or does it follow a different internal metric?

Note 1: If you're considering applying to a graduate school in cognitive science or a related field, I encourage you to get involved with this project. fMRI research can be difficult to access due to its high cost, but working with me offers a valuable opportunity to gain hands-on experience. In addition, I have strong expertise in fMRI data analysis at the PhD level, and I'm confident you’ll learn a great deal that can support your own future research even if your current interest is not in word size representation.

Note 2: I also have data on other factors - such as valence, arousal, and gender - that you’re welcome to explore in your own research.

## Attention
Attention plays a critical role in both human cognition and artificial intelligence. I plan to measure attention using eye-tracking data and incorporate it into algorithm development; or, conversely, use computational models to generate predictions that can be tested against human attention patterns.

Note: This project is still in a very early stage. If you join me on this topic, we’ll start from the ground up: beginning with a literature review and formulating research questions.

## Moreover...
If you're interested in emotional face perception, feel free to reach out. This is an ongoing project led by one of my labmates, which I will be (perhaps) joining soon. Or at least I can introduce you to him.

I'm also open to broader discussions on brain-inspired AI. If you're curious about potential research directions, please check out the [useful links](useful-links.md) page to get a sense of the field.

Additionally, I welcome conversations about fMRI data analysis methods.
