Hi! I’m Junghyun Kim, but I go by Andy. (Fun fact: when I was in kindergarten, I was asked to make an English name. Toy Story was the first and only movie I had seen at the time, so I picked "Andy" since I couldn’t name myself after the toys like Woody or Buzz Lightyear!)

I’m currently a PhD student at Purdue University in the Mathematical and Computational Psychology program. I’m advised by [Anne Sereno](https://engineering.purdue.edu/SerenoLab) (note: the lab website is outdated). Before that, I completed my master’s at Hanyang University in South Korea, where I was advised by [Sungshin Kim](http://commonlab.hanyang.ac.kr/). I earned my undergraduate degree from the University of Toronto and worked as a research intern with [Cendri Hutcherson](https://www.decisionneurolab.com/). Oh, and I graduated from a Chinese high school called [BiGuiYuan, or Guangdong Country Garden School](https://bgy.gd.cn/en//gzbsys.html?lang=en) - if you’re interested in the Chinese economy, you may have heard of the name.

My research interests lie at the intersection of cognitive neuropsychology, computer science, and statistics. I’m passionate about exploring interdisciplinary questions that bridge these fields. For more details, check out my [research](research.md) page.
